            <p>Modern day’s intelligent systems are no longer artificial. The artificial intelligence is in a sense artificial as it does not have biological features. Problem solving using programming is the backbone of Computer Science. However, some qualitative features such as learning and adaptability make a solution independent, which does not require future human intervention. These solutions to different kinds of problems have made human life easier. Some intelligent solutions to problems which we encounter in our day to day lives are medical diagnosis, object tracking, face recognition, social behavior analysis, purchase pattern analysis, recommendation systems etcetera. Conventional intelligence was derived from game theory and hardware automation. However, modern intelligent systems try to mimic the human recognition, analysis and learning capabilities, which are reflected in the existing modern day’s systems.</p>
